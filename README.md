In this tutorial, I will analyze a mouse brain coronal section public dataset.
Key dataset features include:

- Tissue section of 10 Âµm thickness
- H&E image acquired using a Nikon Ti2-E microscope
- Sequencing Depth: 115,569 read pairs per spot
- Sequencing Coverage: Read 1 - 28 bp; Read 2 - 120 bp (transcript); i7 sample index - 10 bp; i5 sample index - 10 bp
- Visium Slide: V19L01-041
- Capture Area: C1
